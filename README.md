# Pi Case 40 GPIO PCB

A replacement PCB for Pi Case 40, that fixes the reversed GPIO Issue.

**Not yet ready or tested**

 - The PCB has been made with KiCAD and is located under PiCase40/. It includes all the schematic symbols, footprints and 3D shapes it uses, in project-specific libraries, located under Library/
 - PCB Reference.FCStd is a FreeCAD file containing the PCB outline and component placements, that can be used as a reference later, when creating the PCB outline and placing the components in KiCAD.
 - Technical drawings showing the PCB dimensions, can be found under Images/

## TODO

0. Finish setting up the README
1. Update the PCB outline from the FreeCAD file.
2. Check component placement again.
3. Order a new PCB and hand solder it, to make sure it fits
4. Buy a Raspberry Pi to test the PCB?
5. Prettify the footprints
6. Figure out a way to make the PCB include the male header riser, so it can be factory assembled by the board house.
7. Update the README
