**Not yet ready or tested**

## TODO

0. Finish setting up the README
1. Update the PCB outline from the FreeCAD file.
2. Check component placement again.
3. Order a new PCB and hand solder it, to make sure it fits
4. Buy a Raspberry Pi to test the PCB?
5. Prettify the footprints
6. Figure out a way to make the PCB include the male header riser, so it can be factory assembled by the board house.
7. Update the README
